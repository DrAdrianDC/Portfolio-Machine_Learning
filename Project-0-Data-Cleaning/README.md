# Project-0- Data Cleaning

The main idea is a comprehesive process of cleaning and preparing raw data for analysis.
By using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Scipy, it includes techniques for handling missing values, standardizing data formats, detecting and removing outliers, and ensuring data consistency. The project aims to showcase best practices in data cleaning to enhance the quality and reability of datsets for further analysis and modeling.
