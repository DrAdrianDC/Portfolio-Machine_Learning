# PCA Feature Reduction

This repository contains code and documentation for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset. PCA is a powerful technique used in data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to identify the most important features and remove redundant ones, thus simplifying the dataset while retaining as much variability as possible.

## Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. **PCA Analysis**: Perform PCA on the dataset to reduce the number of features.


## Results

The new dataset with reduced features after PCA is saved as important_features_dataset.csv

## Requirements

    Python 3.8.3
    Pandas 2.0.3
    Numpy 1.21.0
    Scikit-learn 1.3.2
    Matplotlib 3.2.2
  


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, available in the sklearn.datasets module.
