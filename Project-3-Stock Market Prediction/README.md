# Project-3- Stock Market Prediction

It is important to consider that predicting real-time financial asset prices is extremely complex due to the volatile and non-linear nature of financial markets. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct a thorough analysis and consider the limitations associated with this type of predictions.

Stock price prediction is a challenging yet intriguing problem in the financial domain. In this project, we will use machine learning, specifically neural networks, to predict the future stock prices of a selected company.



### Expected Outcome:

The project aims to develop a neural network-based model that can effectively predict future stock prices based on historical data. The model's performance will be evaluated using standard regression metrics, and improvements will be explored to enhance prediction accuracy.
