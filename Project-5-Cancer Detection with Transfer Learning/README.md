## Project-5 Cancer Detection with Transfer Learning

This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on utilizing transfer learning for cancer detection through medical image analysis. Leveraging the power of pre-trained deep learning models, this project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis by automating the analysis of medical images.

#### Why Transfer Learning?

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model, originally trained on a large dataset for a specific task, is reused as the starting point for a model on a new, but related task. This approach leverages the knowledge gained from the original task to improve the performance on the new task.

Some advantages of Transfer Learning for Image Recognition are:
- Reduced Training Time
- Better Performance with Limited Data
- Easier Model Convergence
- Improved Accuracy

##### Main Objective
Apply Transfer Learning: Utilize the pre-trained model to enhance the accuracy of cancer detection in medical images.

##### Expected Outcomes
Accurate Cancer Detection: Achieve a high level of accuracy in detecting cancer from medical images, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning in this domain.
