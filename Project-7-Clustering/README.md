## Clustering using K-Means

### Overview

Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning technique used to group a set of objects or data points into clusters or groups based on their similarities. The goal is to have data points within the same cluster be more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. Clustering is widely used in various fields, such as marketing, biology, and data mining, to identify patterns and relationships within the data.

Clustering with K-Means is important for simplifying and understanding complex data, uncovering hidden patterns, and improving decision-making. It aids in data preprocessing by creating new features, identifying outliers, and enhancing personalization in recommendation systems. Practical applications include customer segmentation, image compression, document clustering, and genomic data analysis. Despite its limitations, such as sensitivity to initialization and the need for pre-specifying the number of clusters, K-Means remains a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data effectively.


K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm used in unsupervised machine learning for grouping data into clusters based on similarity.
Some reasons why K-Means is commonly used are simplicity and efficiency, etc. K-Means is widely used due to its effectiveness and efficiency, but it has some limitations, such as sensitivity to initial centroid placement and the need to specify the number of clusters k beforehand.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, available in the seaborn datasets module.

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is labeled with three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
